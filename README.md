LCARS inspired app for my tablet

I took a bunch of shortcuts, so this will only work correctly on something sized like a Kindle Fire.  

Since it's for me, it currently only grabs data from Google's Calendar (although the POP settings for email will probably work with other services).

It also usses a Nagios file for monitoring, which probably most people don't care about.

That being said, if this is somehow useful to you, go for it.
